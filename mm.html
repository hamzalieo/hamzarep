                    The second essential is implicit in the first. Although static figures may be as meaningfully symbolic on a stage as in a painting, the deeper revelation of character, as well as the all-important control of the audience’s responses, depends upon a dynamic presentation of the figures in action.</p>A situation must be represented on the stage, one recognizable and believable to a degree, which will animate the figures as it would in life. Some argue that action is the primary factor in drama, and that character cannot emerge without it. Since no play exists without a situation, it appears impossible to detach the idea of a character from the situation in which he is placed, though it may seem possible after the experience of the whole play. Whether the playwright conceives character before situation, or vice versa, is arbitrary. More relevant are the scope and scale of the character-in-situation—whether, for example, it is man confronting God or a man confronting his wife—for that comes closer to the kind of experience the play is offering its audience. Even here one must beware of passing hasty judgment, for it may be that the grandest design for heroic tragedy may be less affecting than the teasing vision of human madness portrayed in a good farce.

            <p class="card-text">A third factor is style. Every play prescribes its own style, though it will be influenced by the traditions of its theatre and the physical conditions of performance. Style is not something imposed by actors upon the text after it is written, nor is it superficial to the business of the play. Rather, it is self-evident that a play will not communicate without it. Indeed, many a successful play has style and little else. By style, therefore, is implied the whole mood and spirit of the play, its degree of fantasy or realism, its quality of ritualism or illusion, and the way in which these qualities are signaled by the directions, explicit or implicit, in the text of the play. In its finer detail, a play’s style controls the kind of gesture and movement of the actor, as well as his tone of speech, its pace and inflection. In this way the attitude of the audience is prepared also: nothing is more disconcerting than to be misled into expecting either a comedy or a tragedy and to find the opposite, although some great plays deliberately introduce elements of both. By means of signals of style, the audience may be led to expect that the play will follow known paths, and the pattern of the play will regularly echo the rhythm of response in the auditorium. Drama is a conventional game, and spectators cannot participate if the rules are constantly broken.

<p class="card-text">By presenting animate characters in a situation with a certain style and according to a given pattern, a playwright will endeavour to communicate thoughts and feelings and to have the audience consider those ideas or reproduce the emotion that inspired the writing of the play. In theatrical communication, however, audiences remain living and independent participants. In the process of performance, an actor has the duty of interpreting the author for the people watching the play and will expect to receive “feedback” in turn. The author must reckon with this circumstance. Ideas may not be accepted if they are offered forthrightly; and great dramatists who are intent on furthering social or political ideas, such as Henrik Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw, and Bertolt Brecht, quickly learned methods of having the spectators themselves reason the ideas as part of their response to the play. Nor will passions necessarily be aroused if overstatement of feeling (“sentimentality”) is used without a due balance of thinking and even the detachment of laughter: Shakespeare and Anton Chekhov are two outstanding examples in Western drama of writers who achieved an exquisite balance of pathos with comedy in order to ensure the affective function of their plays.</p>

  This collection arose from an international conference organised in November
2013 within the framework of the European Research Council Advanced
Grant Project entitled Early Modern European Drama and the Cultural Net
(DramaNet) at the Freie Universität Berlin that brought together experts on
Eastern and Western early modern drama.
