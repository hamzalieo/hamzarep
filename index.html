                  <p class="card-text">I its remarkable century-long history traversing the colonial and nationalist eras, the Parsi theater was unique as a site of communal harmony.
                    The Parsi theater began in Bombay in the early s and fanned out
                    across South and Southeast Asia by the s. During the twentieth century, major Parsi theatrical companies flourished in Lahore, Delhi, and
                    Calcutta, exerting a huge impact on the development of modern drama,
                    regional music, and the cinema. Parsis, Hindus, Muslims, Anglo-Indians,
                    and Baghdadi Jews consorted amicably in both residential and traveling
                    companies. Although company ownership usually remained in Parsi
                    hands, actors were drawn from many communities, as were professional
                    writers, musicians, painters, stage hands, and other personnel. As
                    Såmn≥t^ Gupta makes clear, it was
                    Parsis, non-Parsis, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians who spread the art of
                    theatre by founding theatrical companies, who built playhouses and
                    encouraged drama, who became actors and popularized the art of acting,
                    who composed innumerable dramas in Gujarati, Hindi, and Urdu, who
                    composed songs and defended classical music, and who wrote descriptions
                    of the Parsi stage and related matters.1
                    Audiences similarly were heterogeneous, comprised of diverse religious, ethnic, and linguistic groups and representing a wide range of class

                  <p class="card-text">and based on European opera.5 After the fall of Awadh, the Indar Sab^≥
                    arrived in Bombay and was taken up by Parsi theatrical companies. The
                    Parsi contribution is understood in two stages: () the interest of Parsi
                    schoolboys in dramas on their community’s history, and () the activity of
                    businessmen to turn theater into a commercial enterprise. A pioneering
                    figure, Seth Pestan Framji (probably Pestanji Framji Madan), the founder
                    of the Original Theatrical Company and an Urdu poet himself, receives
                    prominence in the N≥ªak S≥gar. The early period of playwriting and
                    performance in Gujarati, however, is completely overlooked.
                    The subsequent developments in the Parsi theater are organized into
                    a succession of theater companies and a lineage of playwrights. The founders of the companies, some of their leading actors, and their geographic
                    locations are briefly mentioned but little is said of specific companies’
                    innovations. The playwrights discussed are Raunaq, ◊arµf, ∫≥lib, A√san,
                    B®t≥b, ƒashr, ‘Abdull≥h, B®g, Ma√shar, and some minor figures. A
                    particular focus of discussion (and one repeatedly observed in the Urdu
                    sources) is upon language, its evolution in terms of poetry and prose, and
                    its “misuse,” especially in recent dramas that mix Hindi and Sanskrit
                    words. Passages are cited at length from various plays to illustrate the
                    development of a felicitous Urdu idiom. While the authors claim to be
                    above petty quarrels between Hindi and Urdu, they consider it a mark of
                    progress that ∫≥lib introduced songs in Urdu instead of the customary
                    Hindi ones. A√san Lak^navµ’s language is adjudged as pure (p≥kµza).
                    ƒashr’s decision to challenge B®t≥b on his own ground by writing
                    mythological plays in Hindi is painted as a huge mistake.
                    The dominant thrust of the treatment is thus to establish the literary
                    canon of Urdu drama. Beyond a brief mention of costumes and scenery,
                    very little comment is made upon staging. The authors show little interest
                    in or awareness of the English influence upon the Parsi theater. They do
                    not favor the double-stranded plots that were common in the Parsi
                    theater, because the subplot tended toward bawdy humor. Considering
                    the immature state of cinema in , it is noteworthy that the authors
                    vehemently oppose its influence on the theater; cinema is viewed as sensationalistic, immoral, and a direct threat to the stage.
                    Ram Babu Saksena’s A History of Urdu Literature, first published in
                    , is heavily indebted to Il≥hµ and ‘Umar’s compendium, and much of</p>

      <p class="card-text">In his four-volume Urd∑ T^®ªar (first three volumes published in
        , the fourth in ), ‘Abdul ‘Alµm N≥mµ presented a revised version
        of his doctoral dissertation, which became the first comprehensive history
        of the Parsi theater in Urdu. His signal effort to incorporate the minutiae
        of performances, actors, companies, and dramatic literature set a new
        standard, and his work is the primary reference for later authors. N≥mµ’s
        sources, listed at the end of volume , include numerous nineteenth-century travelogues, English, Gujarati and Marathi newspapers, administrative papers and diaries of the East India Company, catalogues from the
        British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, books on English and
        Marathi theater, as well as D^≥njµb^≥’µ Paª®l’s Gujarati history of the Parsi
        theater (see below), articles from Urdu journals Nav≥-e Adab and ¥jkal,
        Am≥nat’s Dµv≥n and Ri¤vµ’s Lak^na’u k≥ ‘Av≥mµ Isª®j.
        Unlike the authors already discussed, N≥mµ is not interested in
        apologizing for the theater or exercising judgment in the selection of a
        canon. Rather, an infectious enthusiasm for the subject pervades the
        work, producing if anything a lack of discrimination and an excess of
        detail. N≥mµ acquired a substantial collection of playscripts, some through
        bribery and illicit dealings as he himself confesses, and his study relies
        upon these texts as well as the oral lore of the theater imbibed with lifelong residence in Bombay. Notwithstanding the advance in methodology
        represented by the use of such sources, later studies have identified
        numerous errors in N≥mµ’s history.
        The organization of the four volumes is as follows: () historical
        background, typology of dramas; (–) playwrights and their dramas; ()
        Parsi theatrical companies. Volume  divides the playwrights into the
        periods –, –, and –, whereas Volume  treats the
        period –. The periods are constructed somewhat artificially to
        separate the authors by religious community. Thus in the section devoted
        to –, N≥mµ lists only Parsi and Hindu dramatists. Early Muslim
        dramatists like Raunaq, ◊arµf, and ‘Abdull≥h are put in the period
        –, although records indicate that their plays were published beginning in . The study is the first in Urdu to acknowledge the Parsi contribution to the creation of a dramatic literature, and the early dramas are
        correctly described as written in Gujarati, or if in Urdu, translated from
        Gujarati. These Gujarati plays, however, are still assimilated under the
        rubric “Urdu theater.” N≥mµ’s treatment includes information about who
        commissioned the play, the date, the company that performed it, the cast,
        and often a summary of the plot.
        In the fourth volume, N≥mµ places Urdu drama within a complex</p>

                <p class="card-text">miracle play, also called Saint’s Play, one of three principal kinds of vernacular drama of the European Middle Ages (along with the mystery play and the morality play). A miracle play presents a real or fictitious account of the life, miracles, or martyrdom of a saint. The genre evolved from liturgical offices developed during the 10th and 11th centuries to enhance calendar festivals. By the 13th century they had become vernacularized and filled with unecclesiastical elements. They had been divorced from church services and were performed at public festivals. Almost all surviving miracle plays concern either the Virgin Mary or St. Nicholas, the 4th-century bishop of Myra in Asia Minor. Both Mary and Nicholas had active cults during the Middle Ages, and belief in the healing powers of saintly relics was widespread. In this climate, miracle plays flourished.</p>
