              There are several ways to purchase Broadway Theatre League Tickets:

Online at Ticketmaster.com
Visit us at Broadway Theatre League, Monday – Friday 9am – 5pm
Visit the VBC Box Office, Monday – Friday 10am – 5pm
Call us at 256-518-6155
Sometimes we offer FastPass Ticketing. This is an online form that does not allow you to select your seats for the show, but we will get you the best seats available for the section you choose. You will only pay one fee of $7 (no other Ticketmaster fees) and we will email your tickets to you. If FastPass is available, a link will be found on the event’s page on our website

              Broadway Theatre League is located in the VBC down the hall from the Concert Hall, between the Concert hall and Playhouse. To visit us, park in the main VBC Ticket Office parking lot on Monroe Street. After entering the main doors, turn right and we are past the Concert Hall, at the end of the hallway on the right.

              We are open Monday – Friday 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and our lunch hour is between 12:00 & 1:00. If you arrive during lunch, we won’t turn you away, but we may ask you to hold our sandwich while we look for your perfect seats. BTL is closed on Federal Holidays and most Mondays after a show weekend.
              
              On the day of each BTL performance, the Concert Hall Box Office will be open one hour prior to each performance time to pick up any WILL CALL tickets or to purchase tickets.
              
              On performance days, please visit the Main Box Office in the VBC Lobby instead of our offices to purchase tickets. We are a small office and our staff often spends most of Friday preparing for the show. 
              
              We are also in and out of the office to answer phones during show weekends, please give us a call at 256-518-6155 if you need anything. If we do not answer right away, please leave a message and we will return your call ASAP. We check messages on show weekend.</div>

              “Is this show appropriate for children?” is a question BTL patrons often ask.

Unlike movies, which are rated by the Motion Picture Association of America and an independent group of parents, live productions have no official rating system. Instead, advisories regarding language, sexual references/ activity, the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, violence, and even the use of strobe lights and fog machines are issued to help parents decide if a show is appropriate for their child.

Because each family has its own set of values, beliefs and child-rearing practices, it is the responsibility of parents to research a show’s content and then decide if it is appropriate for their child. Dozens of show reviews, many written by parents of children and teenagers, can easily be found online. Simply enter the show’s name in your computer’s search engine and follow links.

Information about suitability of a show, if available, can be found at each show’s event page on our website.  Information provided by BTL by phone are developed from our review of each show, material provided by each show and reviews from other venues.</div>

              Broadway Theatre League is known in the industry as a presenter, which simply means we have purchased a professional touring production from a New York agent representing a particular show. Because the shows we purchase are nationally touring, you’ll have to head to New York for an audition. If you do make it, let us know so we can throw a cast party for you when your show hits Huntsville. We wish you luck…. or shall we say, break a leg!

              We strive to make your theatre experience one that you will positively remember! Please let us know if we have accomplished that for you. We’d love to hear from you about a show you enjoyed this season or from a season of the past. We especially like hearing how well our staff is doing!

Sometimes, as much as we try, you may find the need to express a concern and we welcome you to do so. Please let us know about your concern so we can work towards improving your experience.

Email Andrew Willmon, our Executive Director, and let us know!

If you have an issue about the Von Braun Center, we strongly encourage you to contact the VBC directly.
